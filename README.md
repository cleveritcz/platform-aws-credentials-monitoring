# How to use Terraform, Go, AWS Lambda and Slack to monitor the age of your AWS credentials. 

The aim of this project is explain how to notify AWS users when they need to rotate their credentials to be under an imposed age limit.
You can read in more detail in the next [article](https://medium.com/empathybroker/how-to-monitor-the-age-of-your-aws-credentials-using-terraform-go-aws-lambda-and-slack-a9cc0ad322a)

# Requisites
* Terraform v1.0.10
* Terragrunt v0.14.2
* An AWS-account-ID
* Slack-Webhook-URL

# Getting started 

## Lambda function code

The lambda function has been done in Golang. We don't include the zip code but you can generate it executing the [access.sh](https://github.com/EmpathyBroker/aws-credentials-monitoring/blob/master/live/stranger-things/code/access.sh)

## Terraform instructions 

From the path ./stranger-things. We should do the following to deploy the infrastructure: 
    
```sh
$ aws-vault exec <profile> -- terragrunt plan -out=fit.plan
$ aws-vault exec <profile> -- terragrunt apply fit.plan
```    

This create us the infrastructure defined in the [main.tf](https://github.com/EmpathyBroker/aws-credentials-monitoring/blob/master/live/stranger-things/main.tf)
